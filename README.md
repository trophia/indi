# indi : An individual-based fisheries model

`indi` is a C++ library for individual-based (a.k.a agent-based) models of fisheries.
It was developed to implement an IBM for the Indian Ocean skipjack fishery on behalf of the Maldives Ministry of Fisheries and Agriculture (see /projects/io-skipjack/).
Currently, the library is in a very preliminary, skeletal, proof-of-concept state.
